# Tech task accommodation UI

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Requirements

This is a tech task with the following requirements

Accommodation display should show:

- Accommodation Name
- Description
- Type
- Facilities

Room display should show:

- Room Name
- Room Type
- Min & Max Occupancy
- Price of the Room
- Number Available / Sold Out

Styling is responsive

As a bonus I have included some basic filtering

## Limitation

- Unit testing coverage is good, but missing a couple key intergration tests (time)
- Have not check accessibility, tried my best but may be some mistakes
- No pagination or loading state as we are working without an API
- UX is very utilitarian

## Things I would do given more time

- more filtering options, would like a checklist for facilities and price
- move filtering into a sidebar
- include images and extra data given
